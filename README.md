# Concordance
## Team Note Taking App

### Aboout:
Concordance is a note-taking web app that allows users and teams, to create notes, organize them in journals, and share those journals with other users. The key feature that separates Concordance from other note-taking tools is the ‘concordance list.’  This is an algorithm that uses both the content of a given note and its title to generate a list of all other notes that are referenced in and/or referenced by a given note. This allows the user to both see and reference notes connected to the one they are working on. Additionally, in the text editor, a user can click on a note in the concordance list and the note is temporarily appended to the note the user is working on. This completely changes both workflow and collaboration for teams, allowing team members to reference other members' work seamlessly; or allowing users to access related reference documents seamlessly without having to leave the document they are working on. In this way Concordance completely changes the dynamics of workflow.
